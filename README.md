# Predicting a Biological Response
Building as good a model as possible

Business objective: to determine the characteristics by which it is possible to identify customers who are more inclined to open a bank deposit, and thereby increase the effectiveness of the marketing campaign.

Technical task: to build a machine learning model that, based on the proposed characteristics of the client, will predict whether he will take advantage of the offer to open a deposit or not.

The project consists of five parts:
1. Primary data processing
2. Intelligence Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Selection and transformation of features
4. Solving the classification problem: logistic regression and decision trees
5. Solving the classification problem: model ensembles and forecasting
